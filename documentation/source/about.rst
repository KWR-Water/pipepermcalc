Pipepermcalc is developed by KWR Water Research Institute. 
Pipepermcalc calculates the permeation of organic chemicals into plastic drinking water pipes (PE40, PE80, SBR, EPDM, PVC).

Pipepermcalc can perform two types of calculations (forward and reverse)

#. Forward - calculate the maximum or mean daily concentration in drinking water from a known groundwater or soil concentration (see :ref:`forward-example`)
#. Reverse - calculate the maximum or mean daily allowable concentration in groundwater to meet a drinking water limit value for a given chemical (see :ref:`reverse-example`)
